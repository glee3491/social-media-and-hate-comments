In 2019, famous South Korean celebrity Sulli and K-pop idol Hara Goo killed themselves at the age of 25 and 28. Hate comments on their social media were the cause of death. They were suffering from it and been seeing psychiatrists but the constant brutal attack killed them. Why cannot they just ignore those comments?\n<br />As the internet and technology develop, social media is now the most common way for people to communicate around the world. Social media is a great tool for everyone to freely express themselves. However, like any other technology, social media is also a double-edged sword. It gives users the freedom of expression, but also let them hide behind the keyboard. Some users abuse this and attack other users for no reason. Those mean users existed in the past, when social media was not as big as nowadays, too. But why was the issue of hate comments not considerd serious but now?\n<br />\nIn 2020, 3.6 billion users are on social media [1]. THe impact of social media is getting bigger and </p>\n<h1>Why I decided to make voice about this issue</h1>\n<p>As a South Korean who grew up consuming their music and TV shows, the sudden death of popular celebrities was shocking. Especailly the death of Sulli was shocking. Sulli was one of the hosts of a South Korean TV show called 'Night of Hate Comments,' celebrities read hate comments about themselces on the show, so people, including me thought she is fine with getting all the hates. </p>"}
