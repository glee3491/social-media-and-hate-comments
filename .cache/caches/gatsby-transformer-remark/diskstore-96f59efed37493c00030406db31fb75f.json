Basically, if the consequences of the actions is <strong>best overall</strong>, the actions is morally right. <br/>Based on Consequentialism here are the things to consider to find out if posting hate comments on social media is right or wrong: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>i. What are the possibly consequences of posting hate comments on social media?<br/>\nii. What is the best consequence of the actions?\n<br/>\niii. Is it morally right or wrong?\n<br/></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Social Media is full of posts people expressing their feelings or sharing their day to day lives with other users, and people who see that post often leave comments to the post. According to a study, there are various reasons for leaving comments. Benevolent comments are to encourage, for self-satisfaction, or to feel some sense of unity with the society. On the other hand, malicious comments are to resolve a feeling of dissatisfaction, to attack others, or to release their stress [1]. Based on the research, people who post hate comments <strong>express their feelings and release stress</strong> by doing so. But what about people who receive those comments?\nAs I mentioned in the introduction video and introduction page, a lot of people <strong>suffer from hate comments and even chose to commit suicide</strong>. <br/>\nWe can easily think of these two possible consequences of posting hate comments on social media. Which of those two is the best consequence of the actions? <strong>Obviously, expressing feelings and releasing stress is the best conseuquence</strong>. <br/>Based on the consequentialism, we can say leaving hate comments is a morally right action. Do we all agree? <strong>NO.</strong>\nEthics is not just about consequence, as a human, <strong>we have certain moral rules to follow regardless of the consequences and a virtuous person would follow the rules</strong>.</p>\n<h1>Deontology &#x26; Virtue Ethics</h1>\n<blockquote class=\"column-span\">\n  Deontology: Some kinds of action are wrong or right in themselves, regardless of the consequences.<br/>\n  Virtue Ethics: A right act is the action a virtuous person would do in the same circumstances.<br/>\n  <cite>BBC</cite>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Deontology is very different from consequentialism. While consequentialism consider an action is morally right action based on the consequence, deotology consider if an action is identified right. Thus, deontology has a set moral rules to follow as a human. And virtue ethic says the action virtuous person do is a right action.</p>"}
