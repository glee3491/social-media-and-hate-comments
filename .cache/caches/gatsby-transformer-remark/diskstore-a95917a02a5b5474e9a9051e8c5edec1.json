B.</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In a research, the relationship between neutralization and posting malicious comments on social media was studied and have proved that neutralization makes users post more hate comments. Thus, people who get neutralized easily have higher possibility of posting malicious comments. </p>\n<p>According to the study, males are tends to be more affected by neutralization, get easily neutralizes, so they justify posting hate comments as good than females do. However, this does not mean that all the male users will post hate comments, so regulating male users can be a discrimination.</p>\n<h1>Online enviornment</h1>\n<p>According to the same research, online enviornment also accelerates hate commetns on social media.\n<strong>Anonymity</strong>\nFirst, anonymity makes users post more hate comments. People think they are completely anonymous on social media and junstify that posting hate comments is fine because others do not know who left comments. So what I suggest it regulation on anonymity. A lot of social media is not anonymous, people put their personal information, but they can still fake their identity. Engineers can strongly regulate users and make sure all the users are not anonymous. One way is varifying the identity. In South Korea, to make an account for a website or social media, the person has to varify their identity using theri phone number. It does not have to be this exact way, but the point of this solution is varifying user's real identity.</p>"}
