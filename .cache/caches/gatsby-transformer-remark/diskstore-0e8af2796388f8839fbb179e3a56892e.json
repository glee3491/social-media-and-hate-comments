According to a study, there are various reasons for leaving comments. Benevolent comments are to encourage, for self-satisfaction, or to feel some sense of unity with the society. On the other hand, malicious comments are to resolve a feeling of dissatisfaction, to attack others, or to release their stress [1]. Based on the research, people who post hate comments <strong>express their feelings and release stress</strong> by doing so. But what about people who receive those comments? As I mentioned in the introduction video and introduction page, a lot of people <strong>suffer from hate comments and even chose to commit suicide</strong>. <br/>\nWe can easily think of these two possible consequences of posting hate comments on social media. Which of those two is the best consequence of the actions? <strong>Obviously, expressing feelings and releasing stress is the best conseuquence</strong>. <br/>Based on the consequentialism, we can say leaving hate comments is a morally right action. Do we all agree? <strong>NO, because the worst consequence can also happen.</strong>\nEthics is not just about the best consequence, as a human, <strong>we have certain moral rules to follow regardless of the consequences and a virtuous person would follow the rules</strong>.</p>\n<h1>Deontology &#x26; Virtue Ethics</h1>\n<blockquote class=\"column-span\">\n  Deontology: Some kinds of action are wrong or right in themselves, regardless of the consequences.<br/>\n  Virtue Ethics: A right act is the action a virtuous person would do in the same circumstances.<br/>\n  <cite>BBC</cite>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Deontology is very different from consequentialism. While consequentialism consider an action is morally right action based on the consequence, deotology consider if an action is identified right and deontology has it's set moral rules. Therefore, based on deontology, even if an action brings the best consequence, if the action itself is a morally wrong action it cannot be a right act. Then, who and how to decide wheather the action is right or wrong? Here comes the virtue ethics. Virtue ethics argues that a virtuous person will do a morally right action as a human.Thus, if an action that vituous person do is a right actions. Then, who and how to decide wheather the person is virtuous or not?</p>\n<p>Based on Deontology and Virtue Ethics here are the things to consider to find out if posting hate comments on social media is right or wrong:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>i. Is posting hate comment considered a morally right action?<br/>\nii. Who and How to decide wheather the action is right or wrong?\niiI.
