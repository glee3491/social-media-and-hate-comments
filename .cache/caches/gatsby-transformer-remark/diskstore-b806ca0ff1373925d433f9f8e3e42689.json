Especially the death of Sulli was shocking. Sulli was one of the hosts of a South Korean TV show called 'Night of Hate Comments,' celebrities read hate comments about themselves on the show laughing at mean comments, so everyone thought she is fine with getting all the hates. Also, reading hate comments are popular on YouTube, one of the biggest social media platforms. Even in a famous TV show Jimmy Kimmel Live, celebrities read mean Tweets and react to it. We are always exposed to this environment, so people think it is ok to attack others on social media by posting hate comments. But this has been killing innocent people. As a user, as a developer, as a human, we must be respectful and responsible.","position":{"start":{"line":4,"column":1,"offset":38},"end":{"line":7,"column":856,"offset":1072}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h1","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Deontology","position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":3,"offset":1078},"end":{"line":9,"column":13,"offset":1088}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":9,"column":1,"offset":1076},"end":{"line":9,"column":13,"offset":1088}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"raw","value":"<blockquote class=\"column-span\">\nSome kinds of action are wrong or right in themselves, regardless of the consequences.\n</blockquote>","position":{"start":{"line":10,"column":1,"offset":1090},"end":{"line":12,"column":14,"offset":1225}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tagName":"h1","properties":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Virtue Ethic","position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":3,"offset":1231},"end":{"line":14,"column":15,"offset":1243}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":14,"column":1,"offset":1229},"end":{"line":14,"column":15,"offset":1243}}},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"raw","value":"<blockquote class=\"column-span\">\nA right act is the action a virtuous person would do in the same circumstances.\n</blockquote>","position":{"start":{"line":15,"column":1,"offset":1245},"end":{"line":17,"column":14,"offset":1373}}}],"position":{"start":{"line":1,"column":1,"offset":0},"end":{"line":18,"column":1,"offset":1375}}}}
