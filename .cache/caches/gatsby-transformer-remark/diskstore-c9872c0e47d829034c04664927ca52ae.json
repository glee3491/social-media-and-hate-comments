First feature is making users rethink before they post. How this feature works is pretty simple. AI will read the comment after the user clicks post, and if the comment contains words that might offend other users, it will ask the user question like \"Are you sure you want to post this?\". The purpose of asking this question is to make the user rethink the word choice. It is not simply just making the user reconsider, but also let user aware that this comment is not ethically accepted and forces user to not comment it. Second is the Restrict feature.</p>\n<h1>User's Responsibility</h1>"}
