Basically, if the consequences of the actions is <strong>best overall</strong>, the actions is morally right. <br/>Based on Consequentialism here are the things to consider to find out if posting hate comments on social media is right or wrong: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>i. What are the possibly consequences of posting hate comments on social media?<br/>\nii. What is the best consequence of the actions?\n<br/>\niii. Is it morally right or wrong?\n<br/></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Social Media is full of posts people expressing their feelings or sharing their day to day lives with other users, and people who sees that post often leave comments to the post. According to a study, their are various reasons for leaving comments. Benevolent comments are to encourage, for self-satisfaction or to feel some sense of unity with the society. On the other hand, malicious comments are to resolve a feeling of dissatisfaction, to attack others or to release their stress [1]. Based on the research, people who posts hate comments <strong>express their feelings and release stress</strong> by doing so. But what about people who receive those comments?\nAs I mentioned in the introduction video and introduction page, a lot of people <strong>suffer from hate comments and even chose to commit suicide</strong>. <br/>\nWe can easly think of thes two possible consequences of posting hate commments on social media. Which of those two are the best conseuqence of the actions? <strong>Obviously, expressing feelings and releasing stress is the best conseuquence</strong>. So we can say leaving hate comments are morally right action, we all agree? <strong>NO.</strong>\nEthic is not just about consequence, as a human, <strong>we have certian moral rules to follow regardless of the consequences and a virtuouse person would follow the rull</strong>.</p>\n<h1>Deontology &#x26; Virtue Ethics</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some kinds of action are wrong or right in themselves, regardless of the consequences.\n<cite>BBC</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>De</p>\n<h1>Virtue Ethics</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A right act is the action a virtuous person would do in the same circumstances.\n<cite>BBC</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Too many parasites in your body will eventually kill you. In societies with too many parasites, societies will be ruined. Venezuela is a prime example.</p>\n<p>Forms of capitalism that goes wrong are monopolies, fraud, and corruption.</p>\n<p>If Venezuela is an example of a ruined society, at the opposite of the spectrum you will find the West and the U.S. A place where immigrants can come to find the \"American dream\". They can work hard there and become wealthy or earn basic money. Like everything else in this world, wealth or success is relative to what you want. But the amount of opportunity is what makes the difference between these countries.</p>"}
