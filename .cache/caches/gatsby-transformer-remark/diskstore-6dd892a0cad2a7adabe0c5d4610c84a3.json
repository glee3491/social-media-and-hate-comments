The way this feature works is pretty simple. AI will read the comment after the user clicks post, and if the comment contains words that might offend other users, it will ask the user question like \"Are you sure you want to post this?\". The purpose of asking this question is to make the user rethink the word choice. It is not simply just making the user reconsider, but also let users aware that this comment is not ethically accepted and forces users to not post it.\n<br/>\n<strong>Second</strong> is the Restrict feature. This feature is similar to the Blocking feature but slightly different in the way that it gives you flexible options. Restrict feature allows you to restrict a user on Instagram. Once the user is restricted the user's activities will be only visible to the person who restricted the user and he/she has options to be visible in public or not. This prevents other users from contact exposure to hate comment and also protect the user who got the comment.s\n<br/></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtube-creators.googleblog.com/2019/02more-updates-on-our-actions-related-to.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>On February 2019, YouTube updated their actions relate to the safety of minors</strong></a>\n<br/>\nYouTube originally had the option to disable comments on video but this was done by users who do not want people to leave comments on their video. This update automatically disables comments on video featuring minors, mostly refer to children. AI will analyze the video and if it detects children or minors in the video, it will automatically disable comments on that video. This protects minors from getting attacked by hate comments.\n<br/></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.koreaherald.com/view.php?ud=20200220000937\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\"><strong>On February 2020, Naver banned comments on entertainment news</strong></a>\n<br/>\nNaver, South Korea's largest web portal, banned comments on entertainment news after Sulli and Hara committing suicide after suffering from hate comments. This is not an advanced feature using AI or other technology like Instagram or YouTube did and many of the users criticize Naver for taking action slowly. But this change is certainly a movement to protect people who are suffering from hate comments.</p>\n<h1>Proffesional Responsibility</h1>\n<h1>User's Responsibility</h1>"}
