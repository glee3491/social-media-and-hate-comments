How this feature works is pretty simple. AI will read the comment after the user clicks post, and if the comment contains words that might offend other users, it will ask the user question like \"Are you sure you want to post this?\". The purpose of asking this question is to make the user rethink the word choice. It is not simply just making the user reconsider, but also let user aware that this comment is not ethically accepted and forces user to not comment it.\n<br/>\nSecond is the Restrict feature. This feature is similar to Blocking feature but slightly different in the way that it give you flexible options. Restrict feature allows you to restrict a user on Instagram. Once the user is restricted that user's activities will be only visible to the person who restricted the user and he/she has options to be visible in public or not. This prevent other user from contact exposure to hate comment and also protect the user who got the comment.\n<h1>User's Responsibility</h1>"}
