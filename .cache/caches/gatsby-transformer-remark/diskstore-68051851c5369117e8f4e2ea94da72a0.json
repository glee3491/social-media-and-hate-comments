Status is your ranking in the social hierarchy. There are winners and losers. In the hunter and gatherers time, status would equal high power and survival. Wealth did not exist. Examples of current time are politics and sports.</p>\n<p>To win with status, you have to put someone else down. This means that adding all scores would end up in zero.Â <strong>Thus status is a sum-zero game.</strong></p>\n<h1>Wealth creation</h1>\n<p>With wealth creation, everyone can become wealthy. If someone has a house, it doesn't take away the ability for you to have a house. Actually, the more houses we have, the easier (and thus cheaper) it will be to create new houses.</p>\n<p><strong>Wealth, therefore, is a positive-sum game for society.</strong></p>\n<p>This doesn't mean that the wealth-game has no competition. Others will try to steal your ideas or copy your products. But if you create value for society and can stand out, society will reward you immensely.</p>\n<p>People creating wealth will always be attacked by people playing status games - Naval</p>"}
