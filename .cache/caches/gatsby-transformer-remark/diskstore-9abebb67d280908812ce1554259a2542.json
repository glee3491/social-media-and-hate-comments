Basically, if the consequences of the actions is <strong>best overall</strong>, the actions is morally right. <br/>Based on Consequentialism here are the  to consider to find out if posting hate comments on social media is right or wrong: </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>i.

In societies with too many parasites, societies will be ruined. Venezuela is a prime example.</p>\n<p>Forms of capitalism that goes wrong are monopolies, fraud, and corruption.</p>\n<p>If Venezuela is an example of a ruined society, at the opposite of the spectrum you will find the West and the U.S. A place where immigrants can come to find the \"American dream\". They can work hard there and become wealthy or earn basic money. Like everything else in this world, wealth or success is relative to what you want. But the amount of opportunity is what makes the difference between these countries.</p>"}
