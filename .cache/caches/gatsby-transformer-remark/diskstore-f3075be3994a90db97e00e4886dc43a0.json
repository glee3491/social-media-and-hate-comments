Hate comments on their social media was the cause of the death. They were suffering from it and been seeing psychiatrist to overcome but contant brutal attack killed them. Why cannot they just ignore those comments?\n<br /> As the internet and technology develop, social media is now the most common way for people to communicate around the world. In 2020, 3.6 billion users are on social media [1]. Of course, social media is a great tool for everyone to freely express themselves.</p>\n<h1>Why I decided to make voice about this issue</h1>\n<p>As a South Korean who grew up consuming their music and TV shows, the sudden death of popular celebrities was shocking. Especailly the death of Sulli was shocking. Sulli was one of the hosts of a South Korean TV show called 'Night of Hate Comments,' celebrities read hate comments about themselces on the show, so people, including me thought she is fine with getting all the hates. </p>"}
