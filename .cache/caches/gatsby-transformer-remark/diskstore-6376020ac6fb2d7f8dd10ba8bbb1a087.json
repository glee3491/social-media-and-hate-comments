But hard work is absolutely no substitute for who you work with and what you work on. What you work on is probably the most important thing.</p>\n<p><strong>See this as a set of 3 pillars:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>What do you work on? Is there a(n emerging) market for this? Are you excited and do you have specific knowledge about this?</li>\n<li>Who do you work with? Work with those who are great enough to raise your bar, no matter how high your bar is. An example of this is '<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvQ4p82-D54\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">the paypal mafia</a>', they're a group of students who've made each other stinkingly rich.</li>\n<li>How hard do you work? If you've picked the right things previously mentioned, then start working as hard as you can.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>Predator</h1>\n<p>Work as a predator. Sprint as hard as you can when working on something you're passionate about. Especially in moments of inspiration and excitement. Then have a good long rest. Nobody works 80-120 hour long workweeks. This is status signaling and is detrimental to anyone's health.</p>\n<h1>Seize the moment.</h1>\n<p>When you feel inspired and excited, start working on it immediately. If you hesitate or wait too long, the energy of excitement that came with it might die off.</p>\n<h2>Impatience with actions, patience with results</h2>\n<p>If you want to do something, do it now. Don't wait, don't give in to hesitation. But also don't expect instant results. As a society, we're so used to instant gratification, that we've lost the skill to be patient.</p>\n<p>A product takes time and requires countless iterations until you feel it's polished.</p>\n<p>Finding a market to sell your work too, will need lots of research and time.</p>\n<p>Be consistent and keep working until the results slowly but surely drip in. </p>\n<p>So be patient with results.</p>"}
