Especailly the death of Sulli was shocking. Sulli was one of the hosts of a South Korean TV show called 'Night of Hate Comments,' celebrities read hate comments about themselces on the show, so people, including me thought she is fine with getting all the hates. And reading hate comments are popluar on YouTube, one of the biggest social media. </p>\n<h1>Introduction</h1>\n<p>In 2017, Jong Hyun from the famous K-pop idol group SHINee committed suicide at the age of 26. In 2019, famous South Korean celebrity Sulli and K-pop idol Hara Goo killed themselves at the age of 25 and 28. Hate comments on their social media were the cause of death. They were suffering from it and been seeing psychiatrists but the constant brutal attack killed them. It is not just them who died from it. An Australian celebrity Charlotte Dawson also committed suicide in 2012 after getting attacked. In the U.S., a 12-year-old girl killed herself in 2013, after getting bullied on social media. And in Singapore, 59.4% of students were bullied on social media at least once, and 28.5% were targeted with online hate comments [1]. Why cannot they just ignore those comments?\n<br />As the internet and technology develop, social media is now the most common way for people to communicate around the world. Social media is a great tool for everyone to freely express themselves. However, like any other technology, social media is also a double-edged sword. It gives users the freedom of expression, but also let them hide behind the keyboard. Some users abuse this and attack other users for no reason. Those mean users existed in the past, when social media was not as big as nowadays, too. The issue of hate comments was not considered serious in the past but why now?\n<br />\nIn 2020, 3.6 billion users are on social media [2]. The impact of social media is getting bigger, and the number of social media users is increasing worldwide, and is anticipated that around 4.41 billion people will use social media in 2025 [2]. As more and more people are on social media, the hate comments are also getting worse. Hate comments are no longer only targeting celebrities, it is attacking general users who are vulnerable to these attacks.</p>"}
