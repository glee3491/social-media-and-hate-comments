Combined you will have a unique set of skills that you can leverage. Naval advises to not be too deliberate in choosing which skills. You still have to follow your obsession(s) otherwise you might end up choosing something that's not in your natural desire.</p>\n<h1>Reading</h1>\n<p>If you don't enjoy reading, start reading stuff you love, until you love to read. Don't force yourself to read a book you don't enjoy, but move on naturally by whatever interests you.</p>\n<p>Once you love to read and want to read more specific knowledge, avoid reading too much junk. When learning about specific knowledge, always start with the fundamentals of a topic. Don't start with highly specific books, but learn the basics first. If you understand the fundamentals, it will be easier to read more specific knowledge later on. Examples of these books are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adam Smith - the Wealth of nations</li>\n<li>Darwin - Origin of the species</li>\n<li>Watson and Crick - The eigth day of creation</li>\n<li>Richard Feynman - six easy pieces.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don't know a smart person doesn't read and read all the time. </p>\n<p><cite>Naval</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Have the desire to learn. You have to cultivate the desire to learn as all the means to learn are abundant. Children are naturally curious, but once we go into adulthood we lose this sense. So we have to learn how to keep the desire to learn.</p>\n<p>The ultimate foundations of everything is mathematics and logic. If you understand logic and mathematics, then you have the basis for understanding the scientific method. Once you understand the scientific method, then you can understand how to separate truth from falsehood. This is useful in other fields and other things that you’re reading.</p>\n<p>It’s better to read a great book really slowly than to fly through a hundred books quickly. This will help you master the foundations and prevent you from reading too much junk.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I don’t fear the man who knows a thousand kicks and a thousand punches, I fear the man who’s practiced one punch ten thousand times or one kick ten thousand times.</p>\n<p><cite>Bruce Lee</cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>The number of “doing” iterations drives the learning curve</h2>\n<p>To become skilled one has to be doing. You can study a thousand businesses, but starting your own business will teach you more invaluable, unique knowledge by iterating continuously. Doing the same work over and over won't teach you anything new of course. But trying different ways of marketing a product, changing online channels, creating new ways of branding you will learn a lot.</p>\n<p>By doing you will understand the different mental models in business and how to apply them. By studying them, you will only understand what these models are, but you wouldn't know how to apply them.</p>\n<p>If you've played games your whole life, studying game theory makes no sense to you. It's something you would be doing or thinking naturally. Reading books would be a waste of time as it's all common sense.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There’s no actual skill called “business”.</p>\n<p><cite>Naval </cite></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Business in college is often just pattern-matching from so-called '<em>case studies</em>'. You won't learn any real unique skills. Instead you will learn to macro-bullshit (Taleb).</p>\n<h2>Pain</h2>\n<p>Doing something new is painful. It's being on uncertain territory with high odds to fail. So get used to frequent small failures, by doing (new) things from scratch over and over again. If you're willing to bleed a little every day, you may win big later.</p>\n<p>Entrepeneurs go through pain every day. Working on something without guarentee of success. Losing money slowly and finding different ways to support yourself. Stressing out every day and bearing all responsibility.  But when they win, they win big and on average they'll make more.</p>\n<p>Being an entrepeneur basically means being stressed out constantly while risking it every day, aiming for the highest prize.</p>\n<p>So learn how to cope with pain.</p>"}
