Basically, if the consequences of the actions is best overall, the actions is morally right. Then what are the possibly consequences of posting hate comments on social media? and what is the best consequence of the actions?\n<br/></p>\n<h1>Deontology</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Some kinds of action are wrong or right in themselves, regardless of the consequences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since the dawn of time, we've exchanged information with each other and have always kept track of this information in forms of credits and debits. If you worked for someone, you will keep track of your credits and debits.</p>\n<p>What lets the human species cooperate? It is because we can keep track of credits and debits. We ask ourselves: who put in how much work? Who contributed how much? That is all a <strong>free market capitalism</strong> is.</p>\n<p>We need free minds and free markets. Voluntary small-scale exchanges between humans that won't negatively impact others.</p>\n<p>Wealth creation is not about taking. It's about creating abundance in this world.</p>\n<h1>Virtue Ethics</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A right act is the action a virtuous person would do in the same circumstances.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Too many parasites in your body will eventually kill you. In societies with too many parasites, societies will be ruined. Venezuela is a prime example.</p>\n<p>Forms of capitalism that goes wrong are monopolies, fraud, and corruption.</p>\n<p>If Venezuela is an example of a ruined society, at the opposite of the spectrum you will find the West and the U.S. A place where immigrants can come to find the \"American dream\". They can work hard there and become wealthy or earn basic money. Like everything else in this world, wealth or success is relative to what you want. But the amount of opportunity is what makes the difference between these countries.</p>"}
