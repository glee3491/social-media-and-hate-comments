If getting wealthy is your goal, you are going to have to work as hard as you can. But hard work is absolutely no substitute for who you work with and what you work on. What you work on is probably the most important thing.

**See this as a set of 3 pillars:**

1. What do you work on? Is there a(n emerging) market for this? Are you excited and do you have specific knowledge about this?
2. Who do you work with? Work with those who are great enough to raise your bar, no matter how high your bar is. An example of this is '[the paypal mafia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nvQ4p82-D54)', they're a group of students who've made each other stinkingly rich.
3. How hard do you work? If you've picked the right things previously mentioned, then start working as hard as you can.

# Predator
Work as a predator. Sprint as hard as you can when working on something you're passionate about. Especially in moments of inspiration and excitement. Then have a good long rest. Nobody works 80-120 hour long workweeks. This is status signaling and is detrimental to anyone's health.

# Seize the moment.

When you feel inspired and excited, start working on it immediately. If you hesitate or wait too long, the energy of excitement that came with it might die off.

## Impatience with actions, patience with results

If you want to do something, do it now. Don't wait, don't give in to hesitation. But also don't expect instant results. As a society, we're so used to instant gratification, that we've lost the skill to be patient.

A product takes time and requires countless iterations until you feel it's polished.

Finding a market to sell your work too, will need lots of research and time.

Be consistent and keep working until the results slowly but surely drip in. 

So be patient with results.
